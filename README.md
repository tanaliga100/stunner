# React + Vite

*instructions*
1. yarn install 
2. yarn dev


**NOTE:**

I regret to inform you that I was unable to complete the exam. I know that my strength lies more in logical problem-solving, which often leads me to spend additional time on design aspects. I faced difficulties in implementing the UI design, and I acknowledge this as a weakness in my skill set. But anyhow, I enjoyed the time spent on this and appreciate the effort involved. 

Thank You Stunner Dev Team
